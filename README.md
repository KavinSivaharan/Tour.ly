This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

•	Implemented web application using Node.JS and React which when prompted sends a request that hits the endpoint from the frontend, the user’s location is located using Google Maps API then sends a series of requests to the Yelp APIs made to retrieve a list of best reviewed destinations in the user's area. 

•	Implemented a real-time MySQL database to store travel cost between each of these destinations which is determined using Distance Matrix API and stores the information in a MySQL database system.
